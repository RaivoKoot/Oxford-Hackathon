Using a dataset of various room images with a rating of their beauty and with the aid of Azure CustomVision, a model learns to predict how aesthetically pleasing given rooms look. Given this, this application aids users and especially students to easily and quickly find respectable places to rent by web scraping property-sites and applying the machine learning model to evaluate which properties rate the highest, finding the user the most aesthetically pleasing places while still being affordable, saving the user hours of time of searching through the web.

As an alternative to housing price prediction models, which do not factor in the aesthetics of properties, this application can also be used by letting landlords to easily explore housing situations in the same area as their own property in a unique way to get a better understanding of how good their property rates against the competition and to uncover whether their selling factors require changes.
